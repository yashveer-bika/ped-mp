Workflow stuff
1) JavaDocs comment everywhere

Code functionality
- load sioux fall network (Yash)
- Implement the queueing model equations from Te (Rohit)
- Implement Te's signal timing method. This will probably involve using CPLEX; Rohit has previous experience working with it.
- Set up initial conditions on Sioux Falls data
- Run simulation on Sioux Falls data
    - have random turning proportions for peds
    - use turning proportions for vehs from Sioux Falls data


Code Readability stuff
1) Make a parent class for VehIntersection and PedIntersection
    (Intersection) since they are pretty much that same
2) Rename Intersection class to CombinedIntersection (or something like that)

Code optimization stuff
1) Put the following at the network level instead of intersection:
    private HashMap<Integer, Set<Integer>> conflictMap; // includes veh and ped
    private HashMap<Integer, String> numToDirectionMap;
    private HashMap<String, Integer> directionToNumMap;
2) Write a better phase generator??
3) Remove redundant memory stuff???
